# Syntrum Intro

{% hint style="success" %}
**Syntrum** is a multi-layer blockchain infrastructure and ecosystem designed with economic, scalability, and interoperability at its core. It provides developers and projects with the necessary tools and services to build and grow their ventures in a cost-effective manner.

The Syntrum blockchain uses a unique combination of Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) and Proof of Value (PoV) consensus mechanisms to achieve gasless transactions and real-time interoperability without the need for layer 2 bridge applications. With supernodes validating blocks on parallel networks, Syntrum ensures true interoperability in real-time, while ensuring robust network security
{% endhint %}

&#x20;The Syntrum Blockchain offers the following features:

#### True interoperability

The Syntrum Blockchain utilizes a master network (kyrios Chain) that synchronizes with other blockchains through a parallel mirror network technology, allowing dApps to operate seamlessly across all blockchains without the need for bridges.

#### **Gas Free Transaction**

Syntrum Blockchain revolutionizes the way we transact by offering gas-free transactions. Our innovative PoS-PoV consensus mechanism and optimized dApp bandwidth leveling network architecture make this possible. No more network spamming issues - just seamless, gasless transactions.

#### White Label dApp Solutions

Syntrum is more than just a blockchain infrastructure - we offer white label solutions through our dApp-as-a-Service suite. We empower builders and creators in DeFi, GameFi, and NFT products and applications with effective and scalable technologies.

#### Decentralize and Secure

Syntrum uses a hybrid PoS-PoV consensus mechanism, ensuring the security and decentralization of cross-chain interactions. Our super node validation adds an extra layer of security, eliminating the risk of a single point of failure.
