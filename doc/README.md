The Syntrum Blockchain offers the following features:

#### True interoperability

The Syntrum Blockchain utilizes a master network (kyrios Chain) that synchronizes with other blockchains through a parallel mirror network technology, allowing dApps to operate seamlessly across all blockchains without the need for bridges.

#### **Gas Free Transaction**

Syntrum Blockchain revolutionizes the way we transact by offering gas-free transactions. Our innovative PoS-PoV consensus mechanism and optimized dApp bandwidth leveling network architecture make this possible. No more network spamming issues - just seamless, gasless transactions.

#### White Label dApp Solutions

Syntrum is more than just a blockchain infrastructure - we offer white label solutions through our dApp-as-a-Service suite. We empower builders and creators in DeFi, GameFi, and NFT products and applications with effective and scalable technologies.

#### Decentralize and Secure

Syntrum uses a hybrid PoS-PoV consensus mechanism, ensuring the security and decentralization of cross-chain interactions. Our super node validation adds an extra layer of security, eliminating the risk of a single point of failure.
