Syntrum wallet is a multi-utility noncustodial mobile wallet that aims to provide users with a secure and user-friendly option for storing their crypto assets, be it tokens or NFTs. Syntrum wallet offers more than that, it aims to provide a universal gateway or hub where users can have seamless access to dApps and web3 tools.

## Wallet Features and Development Stage

To ensure a smooth launch of Syntrum wallet V1, an alpha launch with limited access is necessary. This marks the first stage in the launch cycle and gives access to interested community members and users to test the app and also participate in our bug bounty. With this, bugs and fixes necessary can be found, reported and fixed before the launch of version 1.

A list of the features that the wallet has, their functionality, and development stage are as presented below

{% tab title="Token Wallet" %}
This is a segment or fragment of the Syntrum wallet that is mainly used to securely store cryptocurrencies, including both coins and fungible tokens. Since Syntrum wallet supports multiple blockchains, it is suitable for holding coins and tokens on all the supported blockchains.&#x20;

Beyond this, this fragment allows users to carry out basic functions or interactions such as sending and receiving cryptocurrencies, accessing the swap features, importing tokens, and many more. As Syntrum aims to be simple and seamless, the token wallet also enables users to pin buttons for the functions they interact with the most.
